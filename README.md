#### **Spotify Api Artist Playcount Tracker**

In this repository project I worked with a team to create a website in javascript utilizing react to display and chart artist and album playcounts from spotify. The project utilizes two different apis (in the future the the second api will no longer be available due to upcost to use it), the two being the spotify api and an api called songstats api. My role in the project was to handle the charts and how api data was handled and put into charts, as well as some of the page features and design.
**Skills**: Javascript/React. Chart.js, React-chart2.js
